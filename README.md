# arduino-drum-kit
A simple midi drum kit made from a broken guitar hero drum kit and an Arduino Leonardo

I use FL Studio for recording or getting the sound while playing and it performs well.

I don't feel any delay but I'm not a professional musician.

I used 1M resistors.

The notes for the different drum sounds are included as comments on top of the file. You need to set the sounds to the pins.
